# Bulk Email Cleaner

There are two stages of email verification: 

1. The sender's mail server determines the addressee's mail server using DNS service.
2. The sender's mail server connects to the addressee's mail server through the SMTP protocol and transmits the message.

## DNS Service 
- The checking software reads the e-mail address syntactically
- signals out the mail domain and sends a request to the DNS server to get the mail server of this domain
